## ðŸ”¨ **Current Projects**

### **Dynamic Machine Learning Model for CDA Product Mappings**  
As part of my work at **Curinos**, I proposed and developed a predictive model using **Scikit-Learn** to map financial products across different banks. This model helps analysts compare products and reduces manual data work by 84%. It's a perfect example of my love for automation and improving workflows.

### **Neuroevolution Flappy Bird**  
This personal project combines my passion for AI and game development. I built a **neural network** that evolves over generations, teaching virtual birds to play **Flappy Bird** better each time. Seeing how AI "learns" from mistakes and adapts over time is truly thrilling.
